# PortfolioWebsite
This is the repository used to create my portfolio website that can be accessed with the link:

https://nurulloboboev.github.io/PortfolioWebsite/


technologies used:
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavaScript (for animations)

As a beginner in web development, I set out to learn the raw basics of creating a static page using HTML and CSS. From this, I began developing my portfolio website from scratch, with no template. 

Some of the items left to complete:
- interactive scrolling animations
- adjusting responsive aspect of flex items on the site
